- (Deploying soon! ⏲️⏳)

## 🍀Technologies Used 🧑‍💻

- **MongoDB**: For efficient data storage. 🏪

- **Reactjs**: Optimising Frontend- UI/UX with modular and well-structured components, routing, and redux management. ⚛️
- **JavaScript**: Driving interactivity and functionality. 🏄
- **jsonwebtokens**: Ensuring secure authentication and seamless user routing across webpages with the help of defined jwt token session . 🛂

# Frontend Updates  ⚛️ 📊
## After long hours of consistency and error handling, I have revised and setup my frontend with react-vite and redux libraries 🗽 🥳
-  **Redux**-state management library handling entire
- backend-authentication, fetching data, user details updation, CRUD operations on resumes and user models efficiently :
- utilising Reducer, actions and slice of react-redux 📃

# Noteworthy Point for Project Building- 🗒️
- Frontend .env environment var to be imported in vite via- import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL(as required)
- components logic and rendering 'return'
- For implementing 'sending Email' functionality using Nodemailer 📫- creating transporter and services via Google.auth.OAuth2-
   - web app must be registered on google dev console for client_id, secret
   - Gmail API v1 services in OAuth 2.0 playground enabled for the app to retrieve refresh token
   - Enabled APIs and Services on Google dev console
- jsPDF library to integrate downloading user resume in PDF-
   - passing required key : properties in new jsPDF object then adding .addImage() and .save() to finalise saving with the specified img and name.


# To Resolve: ⏲️
- Reset password component- to handle configuration in *jwt tokens* as per jsonwebtoken library principles
- while editing the savedResumes of user, achievements section couldnt be mapped-hence, yet to revise the setup!

Happy Coding! 😄💙
